Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- Airgead Banking wanted a program that would show users their potential account savings using compounding interest and scheduled deposits alongside a view of their savings without regular deposits.
  
What did you do particularly well?
- The look and UI were probably the strongest points of this project. There were still a few items to clean up as far as coding practices go.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- I programmed this application all in one file instead of utilizing header files to build my classes and make main() easier to read. I also formatted with tabs. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- Figuring out the two different formulas to use for the differing account balances took some trial and error. I had to look back at an earlier assignment to see how to set up the loops correctly. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- One of the most crucial skills that this project touched on was implementing mathematical formulas over periods of time. This was a very practical application of the kinds of skills that we develop in computer sciences.  

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I tried to keep the program as simple and free of redundant code as possible. One area that needs the most work is this project's adaptablility. It can be changed for different time domains, but much bigger changes would likely require a total rebuild.
